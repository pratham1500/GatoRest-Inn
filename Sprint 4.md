## Sprint 4

### Application Description
The app is called GatoRest Inn. It is a mockup of a hotel website, and it has most features that any hotel website would have. It allows users to login and signup, post queries, check for availabilities, make reservations, and to create service requests. The admin panel gives an admin the power to manage reservations, view and reply to queries, manage service requests, and to manage other admins.
The app also includes an implementation of Leaflet Maps, to show the location of the hotel. This is the basic desription of the app, and a detailed functionality can be seen below.

### Demo Functionality

This shows most of the functionality of the app.

### Cypress Testing
Unfortunately, Flutter and Dart isn't well suited for cypress tests, as elements were rendered by scripts, and no elements had any characteristic recognizable by Cypress left to use. Thus testing could not be done properly.
